# Skills

I have many skills that I have developed during these years of experience in the professional market.
Today, though, my focus is on JS ecossystem: **React**, **Next.js**, **GraphQL**, **TypeScript** and **Node**.

# Open Source
I consider Open Source very important because I can give back to the community everything I already consume from it.  
In addition, I consider it the best way to acquire knowledge in a self-taught way (e.g. studying other people's code and receiving third-party adjustments in repos), as well as practicing social and collaborative skills (e.g. receive code review from people you do not even know, plus the dialogue involved).

I'm creator and maintainer:
