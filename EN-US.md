# Open Source
I consider Open Source very important because I can give back to the community everything I already consume from it.  
In addition, I consider it the best way to acquire knowledge in a self-taught way (e.g. studying other people's code and receiving third-party adjustments in repos), as well as practicing social and collaborative skills (e.g. receive code review from people you do not even know, plus the dialogue involved).
