<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I have many skills that I have developed during these years of experience in the professional market.
Today, though, my focus is on JS ecossystem: <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Node</strong>, also <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>Drizzle</strong>.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>I consider Open Source very important because I can give back to the community everything I already consume from it.<br />
In addition, I consider it the best way to acquire knowledge in a self-taught way (e.g. studying other people's code and receiving third-party adjustments in repos), as well as practicing social and collaborative skills (e.g. receive code review from people you do not even know, plus the dialogue involved).</p>
